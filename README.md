Overview
Chingu Voyage 47 spanned six weeks, with a team of four individuals, all skilled as frontend developers. Together, they collaborated on creating a web application focused on efficiently organizing and managing daily tasks.

The Project
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of this application enables users to create tasks, assigning them dates, priorities, and frequencies, and track their completion. Additionally, users have the ability to delete or update tasks. To enhance accessibility, users can log in using either their Google account or their own login credentials. The team utilized a dataset provided to them, which was then parsed and presented in an interface allowing users to sort tasks by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project presented the team with an invaluable chance to engage in web development firsthand and tackle multi-dimensional datasets. It served as a real-world application for refining their skills and exploring the intricacies of manipulating data within a web-based framework.
